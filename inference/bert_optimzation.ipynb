    "In this session, you will learn how to optimize Hugging Face Transformers models for GPU inference using [DeepSpeed-Inference](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/inference-tutorial/). The session will show you how to apply state-of-the-art optimization techniques using [DeepSpeed-Inference](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/inference-tutorial/). \n",
    "This session will focus on single GPU inference on BERT and RoBERTa models. \n",
    "By the end of this session, you will know optimize your Hugging Face Transformers models (BERT, RoBERTa) using DeepSpeed-Inference. We are going to optimize a DistilBERT model for Question Answering, which was fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset to decrease the latency from 7ms to 3ms for a sequence lenght of 128.\n",

    "\n",
    "[DeepSpeed-Inference](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/inference-tutorial/) is an extension of the [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) framework focused on inference workloads.  [DeepSpeed Inference](https://www.deepspeed.ai/#deepspeed-inference) combines model parallelism technology such as tensor, pipeline-parallelism, with custom optimzed cuda kernels.\n",
    "DeepSpeed provides a seamless inference mode for compatible transformer based models trained using DeepSpeed, Megatron, and HuggingFace. For list of compatible models please see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/deepspeed/module_inject/replace_policy.py).\n",
    "As mentioned DeepSpeed-Inference integrates model-parallelism techniques allowing you so run multi-GPU inference for LLM, like [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) with 176 billion parameters.\n",
